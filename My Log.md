 # 100 Days Of Code - My Log
 https://www.100daysofcode.com/

### Day 0: 13th June 2024

**Today's Progress**: By joining 100-days-of-code I have found a way to show up everyday with the goal to be a proficient coder.  

**Thoughts:** This will be like riding a bike I'm sure. For now I need a quick refresh on Markdown, VSCode while I fork this Repo.

### Day 1: 14th June 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Will identify which projects to complete first before starting anything further ones

**Thoughts** After reviewing and the fact that it has been a while I will not revisit old unfinished repos. Time will be better spent revisiting incomplete courses and starting new repos from scratch instead

### Day 2: 15th June 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: My longer term coding/development goals have changed since my Front End Dev Bootcamp so I'll spend the weekend setting a plan of action

**Thoughts**: The first few weeks will be back to basics refreshing JavaScript, React & wireframes etc 

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 3: 16th June 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing React and exploring Server Side Rendering (SSR). 

**Thoughts** Took a lot longer than I thouht to set up initial stages of a dapp due to VS Code, Next, Node.js version connflicts and dependancy errors. I'll try again during the week.

### Day 4: 17th June 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved previous React Server Side Rendering issues. Set up index.js, importing module styles and images, module css and card modules (functional stateless Card Componennts) mapping imported api data for props, transforming components from stateless to class

**Thoughts** Will use https//ww.github.co/vercel/next.js/tree/canaryexamples for examples to fetch data from external API. ******** After several attempts at exploring errors its satisfying when the app page finally loads. I have noticed errors with the last few days commits  - need to investigate further

### Day 5: 18th June 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved commit issues by cloning the 100 day Repo and archiving the incorrect forked version that doesn't show my commits. Working through React SSR tutorial using Redux for state management ..........

**Thoughts** I need to totally refresh certain aspects of github repos so I don't make that mistake again. Need to refresh folder and file updating to personalise this repo

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 6: 19th June 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Will be completing the SSR exercise then concentrating on Solidity for the next week 

**Thoughts** No actual coding today as only had time to review articles. I need to understand the terminology so will need to review few vids I have for solidity

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 7: 20th June 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Adding Redux store and setup by installing dependencies for Redux (npm i next-redux-wrapper react-redux redux). Creating store by adding states to variables and functions. Creating a wrapper and updating index.js to pass 'store' in initial props ( static async getInitialProps ({store})). Return store.dispatch from the initial cards. (return store.dispatch(initialCards());
import { initStore } from '../store'; (at top) and pass it at bottom of index.js (export default initStore.withRedux(Index);)
Adding Redux Actions to the Redux Implementation. Actions are functions.  Adding Redux Reducers in store.js. 
To test can use npm run build then npm start  - but the faster way is npm run dev - *** Test unsucessful with apparent error due to missing file ssr\.next\trace']   errno: -4048, ***

**Thoughts** Although this Redux exercise was unsuccessful, it was very useful session to help with reminding me of terminology & structure

### Day 8: 21st June 2024  - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning path for blockchain to complete the certificate  - todays exercise is Blockchain: Learning Solidity 2018. Solidity Syntax, Types, Units, Variables (inc Global), Functions, Operators, Conditionals. 

**Thoughts**: Being relatively new to coding; Solidity vids previously didn't click with me, but I think that it is beneficial for me, and suits my learning style, to see multiple examples and formats. The daily format of little and often is really helping me to not only keep focus but to realise that I am making some progress


### Day 9: 22nd June 2024  - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Having previously completed an exercise of a Solidity First Smart Contract, I now have a better understanding of the variables, modifiers, and functions. 



### Day 10: 23rd June 2024  - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Solidity syntax basics to set up solidity file (.sol) Import Solidity and filenames



### Day 11: 24th June 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Will continue to complete the vids exercises using Remix then .... go back to the Docker instructions and complete it again .....



### Day 12: 25th June 2024  - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Working through several exercises to be confident before moving on
