 https://www.100daysofcode.com/

### Day 0: 13th June 2024

**Today's Progress**: By joining 100-days-of-code I have found a way to show up everyday with the goal to be a proficient coder.  

**Thoughts:** This will be like riding a bike I'm sure. For now I need a quick refresh on Markdown, VSCode while I fork this Repo.

### Day 1: 14th June 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Will identify which projects to complete first before starting anything further ones

**Thoughts** After reviewing and the fact that it has been a while I will not revisit old unfinished repos. Time will be better spent revisiting incomplete courses and starting new repos from scratch instead

### Day 2: 15th June 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: My longer term coding/development goals have changed since my Front End Dev Bootcamp so I'll spend the weekend setting a plan of action

**Thoughts**: The first few weeks will be back to basics refreshing JavaScript, React & wireframes etc

### Day 3: 16th June 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing React and exploring Server Side Rendering (SSR). 

**Thoughts** Took a lot longer than I thouht to set up initial stages of a dapp due to VS Code, Next, Node.js version connflicts and dependancy errors. I'll try again during the week.

### Day 4: 17th June 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved previous React Server Side Rendering issues. Set up index.js with logo, module css and card modules using api data for props

**Thoughts** After several attempts at exploring errors its satisfying when the app page finally loads. I h ave noticed errors with the last few days commits  - need to investigate further

### Day 4: 18th June 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved commit issues by cloning the 100 day Repo and archiving the incorrect forked version that doesn't show my commits

**Thoughts** I need to totally refresh certain aspects of github repos so I don;t make that mistake again. Need to refresh folder and file updating to personalise this repo
