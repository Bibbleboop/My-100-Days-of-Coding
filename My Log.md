 # 100 Days Of Code - My Log
 https://www.100daysofcode.com/

### Day 0: 13th June 2024

**Today's Progress**: By joining 100-days-of-code I have found a way to show up everyday with the goal to be a proficient coder.  

**Thoughts:** This will be like riding a bike I'm sure. For now I need a quick refresh on Markdown, VSCode while I fork this Repo. 

**Link to work:** 



### Day 1: 14th June 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Will identify which projects to complete first before starting anything further ones

**Thoughts** After reviewing and the fact that it has been a while I will not revisit old unfinished repos. Time will be better spent revisiting incomplete courses and starting new repos from scratch instead

### Day 2: 15th June 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: My longer term coding/development goals have changed since my Front End Dev Bootcamp so I'll spend the weekend setting a plan of action

**Thoughts**: The first few weeks will be back to basics refreshing JavaScript, React & wireframes etc 

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 3: 16th June 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing React and exploring Server Side Rendering (SSR). 

**Thoughts** Took a lot longer than I thouht to set up initial stages of a dapp due to VS Code, Next, Node.js version connflicts and dependancy errors. I'll try again during the week.

### Day 4: 17th June 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved previous React Server Side Rendering issues. Set up index.js, importing module styles and images, module css and card modules (functional stateless Card Componennts) mapping imported api data for props, transforming components from stateless to class

**Thoughts** Will use https//ww.github.co/vercel/next.js/tree/canaryexamples for examples to fetch data from external API. ******** After several attempts at exploring errors its satisfying when the app page finally loads. I have noticed errors with the last few days commits  - need to investigate further

### Day 5: 18th June 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved commit issues by cloning the 100 day Repo and archiving the incorrect forked version that doesn't show my commits. Working through React SSR tutorial using Redux for state management ..........

**Thoughts** I need to totally refresh certain aspects of github repos so I don't make that mistake again. Need to refresh folder and file updating to personalise this repo

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 6: 19th June 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Will be completing the SSR exercise then concentrating on Solidity for the next week 

**Thoughts** No actual coding today as only had time to review articles. I need to understand the terminology so will need to review few vids I have for solidity

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 7: 20th June 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Adding Redux store and setup by installing dependencies for Redux (npm i next-redux-wrapper react-redux redux). Creating store by adding states to variables and functions. Creating a wrapper and updating index.js to pass 'store' in initial props ( static async getInitialProps ({store})). Return store.dispatch from the initial cards. (return store.dispatch(initialCards());
import { initStore } from '../store'; (at top) and pass it at bottom of index.js (export default initStore.withRedux(Index);)
Adding Redux Actions to the Redux Implementation. Actions are functions.  Adding Redux Reducers in store.js. 
To test can use npm run build then npm start  - but the faster way is npm run dev - *** Test unsucessful with apparent error due to missing file ssr\.next\trace']   errno: -4048, ***

**Thoughts** Although this Redux exercise was unsuccessful, it was very useful session to help with reminding me of terminology & structure

### Day 8: 21st June 2024  - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning path for blockchain to complete the certificate  - todays exercise is Blockchain: Learning Solidity 2018. Solidity Syntax, Types, Units, Variables (inc Global), Functions, Operators, Conditionals. 

**Thoughts**: Being relatively new to coding; Solidity vids previously didn't click with me, but I think that it is beneficial for me, and suits my learning style, to see multiple examples and formats. The daily format of little and often is really helping me to not only keep focus but to realise that I am making some progress


### Day 9: 22nd June 2024  - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Having previously completed an exercise of a Solidity First Smart Contract, I now have a better understanding of the variables, modifiers, and functions. 



### Day 10: 23rd June 2024  - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Solidity syntax basics to set up solidity file (.sol) Import Solidity and filenames



### Day 11: 24th June 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Will continue to complete the vids exercises using Remix then .... go back to the Docker instructions and complete it again .....



### Day 12: 25th June 2024  - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Working through several exercises to be confident before moving on



### Day 13: 26th June 2024 - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Continue working through several exercises 



Tutorials 
### Day 14: 27th June 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Working through Remix Tutorials including interface, Remix Project to understand Remix IDE Plug-Ins and visual debugger..

**Thoughts**: There is a lotof information to consume here so I'll note this section to return to until fully proficient ... **** REMIX INFO - Learneth Tutorial Platform Integrated into Remix - includes quizzes for testing, ran by Solidity Unit Tests ****



### Day 15: 28th June 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Remix, reading docs to better understand Core Modules including deployment and forking

**Thoughts**:



### Day 16: 29th June 2024  - Saturday

**Thoughts**: 



### Day 17: 30th June 2024  - Sunday (Happy Birthday to Me)

**Today's Progress**: Attempting to deploy and run transactions in Ephemery & Sepolia Testnets in Remix Tutorials

**Thoughts**: Ran into issues at several stages, including attempting to add Sepolia PoW Faucet as it now requires a gitcoin passport. I did begin to set up a gitcoin passport (https://passport.gitcoin.co/#), sucessful in some areas buut not in others - I will return to this when I have more time as I didn't understand all of it ...



### Day 18: 1 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Trying to continue solidity exercises already started. Added to my daily tasks by starting thirdwebs Onchain Olympics, where a different NFT is minted everyday for 30 days, with docs and chain info for a differnt chain each day. 

#stellarchallenge - Stellar Challenge Starts 10th July  - This needs Scheduling in prior to start to keep upto date 

**about #stellarchallenge - Stellar Challenge Starts 10th July  - This needs Scheduling in prior to start to keep upto date  ISSThoughts**: My daily plans seem to get derailed by side quests and I end up not finishing anything, whilst starting something else. I will need to find a way to better track this and enable me to focus on plans 



### Day 19: 2 July 2024  - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up Issues to attempt to keep track of everything  - and milestomes to set timeframes. 

**Thoughts**: This will be ongoing and needs regular review to ensure don't get too sidetracked by other side quests. Hopefully this will help me keep focused. 



### Day 20: 3 July 2024  - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Focus to complete Solidity Intros

**Thoughts**: I do have some vscode that I can match to the exercises to complete the certificates - Totally side tracked today with vs code and copilot, solidity scan, solidity tokens on solscan. Managed to not spend more than an hou on each and ended up back at React Compiler. 



### Day 21: 4 July 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing with article on React Compiler and added issue for it. Added Lables to issues to help with my daily prioritsation as I want to get coding as soon as I can but I keep getting pulled back to where gaps in my knowledge are. Stellar Challenge starts 10th July. 

**Thoughts**: I will make priority for reading on 3 different topics for next 2 weeks and this will help me feel like I am making some progress instead of going on a million tangents every day



### Day 22: 5 July 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: In additional to daily reading (above), over the weekend I will spend the bulk of time on the folowing : Eat The Blocks  Build a SINGLE Blockchain app for ALL smart contracts -  https://www.youtube.com/live/AznyJDTby1g
