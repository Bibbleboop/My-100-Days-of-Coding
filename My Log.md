 # 100 Days Of Code - My Log (Days with no progress will not be counted - hence 100 days is longer than 100 calendar days)
 https://www.100daysofcode.com/

### Day 0: 13th June 2024

**Today's Progress**: By joining 100-days-of-code I have found a way to show up everyday with the goal to be a proficient coder.  

**Thoughts:** This will be like riding a bike I'm sure. For now I need a quick refresh on Markdown, VS Code while I fork this Repo. 

**Link to work:** 


### Day 1: 14th June 2024 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Will identify which projects to complete first before starting anything further ones

**Thoughts** After reviewing and the fact that it has been a while I will not revisit old unfinished repos. Time will be better spent revisiting incomplete courses and starting new repos from scratch instead

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 2: 15th June 2024 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: My longer term coding/development goals have changed since my Front End Dev Bootcamp so I'll spend the weekend setting a plan of action

**Thoughts**: The first few weeks will be back to basics refreshing JavaScript, React & wireframes etc 

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 3: 16th June 2024 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing React and exploring Server Side Rendering (SSR). 

**Thoughts** Took a lot longer than I thought to set up initial stages of a Dapp due to VS Code, Next, Node.js version conflicts and dependency errors. I'll try again during the week. 

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 4: 17th June 2024 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved previous React Server Side Rendering issues. Set up index.js, importing module styles and images, module CSS and card modules (functional stateless Card Components) mapping imported API data for props, transforming components from stateless to class

**Thoughts** Will use https//ww.github.co/vercel/next.js/tree/canaryexamples for examples to fetch data from external API. ******** After several attempts at exploring errors its satisfying when the app page finally loads. I have noticed errors with the last few days commits  - need to investigate further

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 5: 18th June 2024 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved commit issues by cloning the 100 day Repo and archiving the incorrect forked version that doesn't show my commits. Working through React SSR tutorial using Redux for state management ..........

**Thoughts** I need to totally refresh certain aspects of GitHub repos so I don't make that mistake again. Need to refresh folder and file updating to personalise this repo

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 6: 19th June 2024 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Will be completing the SSR exercise then concentrating on Solidity for the next week 

**Thoughts** No actual coding today as only had time to review articles. I need to understand the terminology so will need to review few vids I have for solidity

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 7: 20th June 2024 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Adding Redux store and setup by installing dependencies for Redux (npm i next-redux-wrapper react-redux redux). Creating store by adding states to variables and functions. Creating a wrapper and updating index.js to pass 'store' in initial props ( static async getInitialProps ({store})). Return store.dispatch from the initial cards. (return store.dispatch(initialCards());
import { initStore } from '../store'; (at top) and pass it at bottom of index.js (export default initStore.withRedux(Index);)
Adding Redux Actions to the Redux Implementation. Actions are functions.  Adding Redux Reducers in store.js. 
To test can use npm run build then npm start  - but the faster way is npm run dev - *** Test unsuccessful with apparent error due to missing file ssr\.next\trace']   errno: -4048, ***

**Thoughts** Although this Redux exercise was unsuccessful, it was very useful session to help with reminding me of terminology & structure

**Link(s) to work**



### Day 8: 21st June 2024  - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning path for blockchain to complete the certificate  - todays exercise is Blockchain: Learning Solidity 2018. Solidity Syntax, Types, Units, Variables (inc Global), Functions, Operators, Conditionals. 

**Thoughts**: Being relatively new to coding; Solidity vids previously didn't click with me, but I think that it is beneficial for me, and suits my learning style, to see multiple examples and formats. The daily format of little and often is really helping me to not only keep focus but to realise that I am making some progress


### Day 9: 22nd June 2024  - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Having previously completed an exercise of a Solidity First Smart Contract, I now have a better understanding of the variables, modifiers, and functions. 



### Day 10: 23rd June 2024  - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of Solidity Smart Contracts

**Thoughts**: Solidity syntax basics to set up solidity file (.sol) Import Solidity and filenames



### Day 11: 24th June 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Will continue to complete the vids exercises using Remix then .... go back to the Docker instructions and complete it again .....



### Day 12: 25th June 2024  - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Working through several exercises to be confident before moving on



### Day 13: 26th June 2024 - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learning Solidity vids and exercises

**Thoughts**: Continue working through several exercises 



Tutorials 
### Day 14: 27th June 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Working through Remix Tutorials including interface, Remix Project to understand Remix IDE Plug-Ins and visual debugger..

**Thoughts**: There is a lot of information to consume here so I'll note this section to return to until fully proficient ... **** REMIX INFO - Learneth Tutorial Platform Integrated into Remix - includes quizzes for testing, ran by Solidity Unit Tests ****



### Day 15: 28th June 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Remix, reading docs to better understand Core Modules including deployment and forking

**Thoughts**:



### Day 16: 29th June 2024  - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Working through LEARNETH staring at beginner level for total back to basics knowledge. Including Loading, Compiling & Deploying: Remix's interface and concepts used in Ethereum. 

**Thoughts**: 



### Day 17: 30th June 2024  - Sunday (Happy Birthday to Me)

**Today's Progress**: Attempting to deploy and run transactions in Ephemery & Sepolia Testnets in Remix Tutorials

**Thoughts**: Ran into issues at several stages, including attempting to add Sepolia PoW Faucet as it now requires a gitcoin passport. I did begin to set up a gitcoin passport (https://passport.gitcoin.co/#), successful in some areas but not in others - I will return to this when I have more time as I didn't understand all of it ...



### Day 18: 1 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Trying to continue solidity exercises already started. Added to my daily tasks by starting thirdweb Onchain Olympics, where a different NFT is minted everyday for 30 days, with docs and chain info for a different chain each day. 

#stellarchallenge - Stellar Challenge Starts 10th July  - This needs Scheduling in prior to start to keep up to date 

**about #stellarchallenge - Stellar Challenge Starts 10th July  - This needs Scheduling in prior to start to keep up to date : My daily plans seem to get derailed by side quests and I end up not finishing anything, whilst starting something else. I will need to find a way to better track this and enable me to focus on plans 



### Day 19: 2 July 2024  - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up Issues to attempt to keep track of everything  - and milestones to set timeframes. 

**Thoughts**: This will be ongoing and needs regular review to ensure don't get too side-tracked by other side quests. Hopefully this will help me keep focused. 



### Day 20: 3 July 2024  - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Focus to complete Solidity Intros

**Thoughts**: I do have some VS Code that I can match to the exercises to complete the certificates - Totally side tracked today with vs code and co-pilot, solidity scan, solidity tokens on Solscan. Managed to not spend more than an hou on each and ended up back at React Compiler. 



### Day 21: 4 July 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing with article on React Compiler and added issue for it. Added Labels to issues to help with my daily prioritisation as I want to get coding as soon as I can but I keep getting pulled back to where gaps in my knowledge are. Stellar Challenge starts 10th July. 

**Thoughts**: I will make priority for reading on 3 different topics for next 2 weeks and this will help me feel like I am making some progress instead of going on a million tangents every day



### Day 22: 5 July 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: In additional to daily reading (above), over the weekend I will spend the bulk of time on the following : Eat The Blocks  Build a SINGLE Blockchain app for ALL smart contracts -  https://www.youtube.com/live/AznyJDTby1g


**Thoughts**:



### Day 23: 6 July 2024  - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Started Quests in Stellar Challenge in prep for challenge starting on 10th. 

**Thoughts**: As this has an element of gameplay to it with levels & sizes of quests, and rewards it should be more engaging than other challenges I've encountered so setting up the wallet to complete the badge was easy.



### Day 24: 7 July 2024  - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: https://quest.stellar.org/learn/series/1/quest/1

**Thoughts**: The trial and error aspect of this is enjoyable, so although I have had a failed attempt at Quest 1 Payment Operations its not as dry as other approaches undertaken previously so retaining information should be easier. On reflection if I had followed the instructions instead of just having a bash ..


### Day 25: 8 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: https://quest.stellar.org/learn/series/1/quest/1  Made progress with Stellar Quest Payment Operations/Create Account. 

**Thoughts**: Will come back to this as I have attempted payment/Operations/Payment and keep getting errors. I am finding this frustrating, but this is all part of the learning experience. I have found vids to check if I have a few failed attempts. (https://www.youtube.com/@everythingstellar. Payment quest completed after funding account 2 so it can receive funds. Checking the transaction on Stellar Expert is advisable before verifying to avoid unnecessary errors. Creating a Trust Line 



### Day 26: 9 July 2024  - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Stellar Quests level1 Path Payments for sending/ receiving assets different from received or sent asset. As opposed to in a classic payment scenario where asset sent is same as asset received, Path Payments do not directly transfer from one account to the other. Path Payments cross through Dex or Liquidity pools, sometimes multiple times to get to end destination. For example: Account A sells XLM → [buy XLM / sell ETH → buy ETH / sell BTC → buy BTC / sell USDC] → Account B receives USDC. These can fail if no viable exchange paths therefore required DEX offer or liquidity pool exchange path in existence. But its convenient operation for currency conversion.
This quest uses 4 different prefunded keypairs (Quest/ Issuer/ Distributor/ Destination). The flow for this Path Payments Task is: Dist acc trusts the future issuing account; Create token for second wallet (issuer); send tokens to third wallet (distributer); Distribution wallet puts a sell order for asset; Receiving wallet (4th/ Destination wallet) trusts the asset; Quest account (primary) sends path  payment to receiving (destination) as new asset xlm -> asset

**Thoughts**: This Task is more challenging with areas I have not covered previously so hopefully I will retain the concepts going forward. LEVEL 01 - Payment Operations -  accounts and payments in this fundamental series completed

summarise above few days after completed tasks**
______________________________________________________________________________

### Day 27: 10 July 2024  - Wednesday am  

**Today's Progress**: LEVEL 02 - Configuration Operations - Time to dig a little deeper with some more complex account-level operations. 1. Account Merge - Delete an account by transferring its XLM balance to another account. 

**Thoughts**:

### Day 27: 10 July 2024  - Wednesday pm

**Today's Progress**: about #stellarchallenge - Stellar Challenge Starts 10th July  - Quests undertaken this week prior to todays start date  

**Thoughts**:  Continuing Stellar Challenge prerequisites



### Day 28: 11 July 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Stella Quest Configurations Operations, Account Merge, Manage Data, Set Options - Home Domain, Set Options - Weight, Thresholds and Signers, Set Flags

**Thoughts**: **Thoughts**:  Continuing Stellar Challenge prerequisites



### Day 29: 12 July 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Today's Progress: Stella Quest connected to Soraban Test Network

**Thoughts**:



### Day 30: 13 July 2024  - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: On the Soraban Test Network, Generated a keypair and funded it through a test network account. This is a friendbot is a horizon API endpoint that funds the account with 10,000 lumens on the test network. Keypairs are used for the Stellar tasks as an account master key, account signer, and or as a stellar-core node key. 

**Thoughts**: The Multi-Sig quest using Set Options - Weights, Thresholds, and Signers is proving difficult so I am referring to the Tutorial Vid. The error I was getting on this quest was not understanding from the instructions that I was also required to make a payment to the second wallet, in order to complete the quest



### Day 31: 14 July 2024  - Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Every transaction (even failed ones) are identified by a unique Sequence Number. Using Bump Sequence allows you to create different smart contract scenarios with different outcomes by setting the operation type to a different number (and submitting) before creating different outcomes from which you can choose a valid scenario at a later date (depending on the real life event)

**Thoughts**: Don't forget to +1 to the new sequence number when building the next transaction

Stellar Quest - Sponsorship  - Sponsored Reserves use three operations - Begin, End & Revoke. Begin and End Sponsoring Future Reserves are sandwiched together for a specific set of operations, but no ongoing sponsorship of future reserves takes place. Revoke, transfers the funds back to the Sponsor.  Quest Account should be zero (I have already funded it) so need to create a new account to transfer the funds away from Quest Account 



### Day 32: 15 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Stellar Quest - Sponsorship

**Thoughts**: This quest took me a while and was frustrating at times as I couldn't decipher all the error codes. I had to walk away from it and contact discord, who suggested alternatives that I had not tried. I had funded the quest account in error and went off script trying to create a zero balance, at this stage I thought I had broken it and would need a reset. It was a frustrating but useful day and I did complete it as soon as I had admitted defeat and posted the error code to discord. The most important thing I have learned is that I should test every single entry of the transaction and operations, even if I think an entry is definitely correct. 


### Day 33: 16 July 2024  - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Stellar Quest - Claimable Balances

**Thoughts**: Claimable Balances is alternative to opening trust lines to make non-native payments by splitting the payment. Create Claimable Balance Operation holds the payment from the sender Onchain. Then the Create Claimable Balance Operation is where the destination account sends/holds the claimable balance for the claimant to accept after conditions are satisfied. Up to 10 claimants/recipients can be set (and can include yourself), but the balance can only be claimed by the first person as long as the predicate conditions are satisfied.  Unconditional can be claimed at any time but Conditional will be time-based. Either Relative time or Absolute time  - e.g. x minutes to have passed but before a certain date. Claimable Balance Operation is where the recipient can use the Claimable Balance ID to claim and sign online to receive this balance, if any preconditional actions have been met

Stellar Quest - Clawbacks - Clawbacks are possible on Stellar if they have a flag set up on the public ledger prior to transactions (not available retospectively) - This is called a clawback-enabled asset, and will burn (remove and destroy) the specified amount from a recipients balance. Required to meet securities regs etc and sueful in cases of fraud or error. Regulated assets (money market funds, bonds, equities) issuance is simplified with asset clawbacks on Stellar. Operations include: Issuing account set up to be clawback-enabled, Issue of the asset, Burn the asset (or portion of) after being Clawed back. 
Operations
 Set Options/ Set Flags  Authorise Clawback enabled (relates to all subsequent trustlines from the source account in trabsaction) 
            / Set Flags  Authorisation Revocable (allows issuer to revoke authorisation by pulling all trustlines)
 Clawback / Specify Asset & Account Clawing back from receipient 

 

### Day 34: 17 July 2024  - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**:  Stellar Quest  - Liquidity Pools are improved on Stellar with the (AMM) Automatic Market Maker functionality. New Features & Operations have been added since the implementation of Protocol 18 and CAP-0038 (see below***). These enable Onchain, constant product AMMs on the Stellar Network via the Liquidity Pool (LP) feature. 

Objectives of this Quest: 
  * Open a new LP with Quest Account by making an initial deposit/ Change Trust/Liquidity Pool Shares/ endpoint for Liquidity Pool ID
  * Use the LP with a path payment operation from another account **
  * Close the position in the LP with Quest Account and receive any fee rewards

***(Core Advancement Proposals, or CAPS, are ideas/suggestions that guide the development and direction of the Stellar network)
** see formula for logic for account debits as LP Deposits and withdrawal is not linear due to refill required to keep pools price balanced. https://quest.stellar.org/learn/series/3/quest/5
FURTHER READING: https://quest.stellar.org/learn/series/3/quest/5

**Thoughts**: This final quest was more challenging but I managed to complete quests quicker today with only minimal help from the video. CLASSIC QUESTS COMPLETED 16 of 16

SIDE QUEST 1 Fee Bump Transactions 
Do not enter final submit until both transaction payment and fee bump have both been submitted independently in transaction submitter (using only 1 signature for each)

SIDE QUEST 2 Mint an NFT on Stellar Blockchain
  * Using IPFS NFT.Storage (https://nft.storage/) To upload Image for this Quest 
  * Best practices for NFTs on Stellar  - SEP-0039 Interoperability Recommendations for NFTs (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0039.md)

  * .... this is not complete as I could not locate Stellar on the Options when attempting to Upload NFT Image to NFT.Storage.....


### Day 35: 18 July 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: To Read up on Merge Dev Hackathon (July 22 **- Sept 9th) - did not complete

**Thoughts**:




### Day 36: 22 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: MERGE - Dev Hackathom - Reusable Creativity on WIX Studio

**Thoughts**:



### Day 37: 23 July 2024  - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Stellar Smart Contract Challenge  - Ensuring I understand the brief and using Perplexity.ai whilst brain storming ideas for this challenge. Rust and Soroban are required also. 

**Thoughts**:



### Day 38: 25 July 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Researching Rust and Soroban
Side tracked by SideQuest Smart Contract crypto trading bot- Intro to Infura.io  - infura Abi - ethers - foundry  - anvil. 
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
anvil (This will start a local Ethereum testnet node.



**Thoughts**: Took a while to install foundry, but I figured out how to move my folders to find the same folder on bash and vscode (bash was picking up from the cloud that didn't contain current project)


### Day 39: 29 July 2024  - Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Pickinup on Crypto trading bot. Using Uniswap v2 Contract Deployments factoryAddress on Ethereum Mainnet to create blockchain.json file and copying array from factoryAbi to allow us to connect to the contract.  bot.js (mainfile) Etheres library required for WebSocketProvider (and factory) to read values from dot.env file. The facroryAddress is pulled through from json file. Set up listener to show details of new liquidity pool. Timeout promise function added for ms delay. 
* new WebSocketProvider(process.env.LOCAL_RPC_URL_WS) = local blockchain forked from main blockchain for testing so a) don't have to wait for real events from the blockchain  b) its better to fork incase there are bugs. Forked cooy (local copy) to create a new liquidity pool (for no cost as it mirrors the actual blockchain), using tools inc Foundry (framework for developing smart contracts) which has a utility called Anvil, a local blockchain to fork from. Create script file using Makefile, and use Infura.io to run anvil as follows.  

**Thoughts**:
A lot of new terms here that I will need oo understand before continuing inc, websockets, .env files contents and purpose. (https://www.infura.io/blog/post/how-to-use-dotenv-to-enhance-basic-security-within-your-dapp)
VSCode Foundry Test runner extension
 
Having immense issues with tryng to run foundry and anvil from terminal in VSCode. Update ..Check that VSCode Terminal is Bash not Poershell. When Clone Repo then fork it. 
I am at 30mins ish on this vid and have spent hours trying to understand how to get anvil to work https://www.youtube.com/live/v7Y7F60YdFQ



### Day 40: 30 July 2024  - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Using copilot and codespaces to overcome issues with laoding foundry and anvil

**Thoughts**: Crypto Bot Respository is in a mess atm but was able to load Foundry using codespaces so it was a sucessful day - I will follow up with this tommorow and will hopefully make some progress (fingers crossed) This log is messy also but the comments are an aide memoire and I will summarise each section at end of 100 days when reflecting on what I have acheived and preparing my next steps. 



### Day 41: 31 July 2024  - Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Crypto Sniping Bot cont - Connect to UniswapV2Factory.col (smart contract that creates liquidity pools) Create new liquidity pool by creating a pair, token0 and token1 and listen to the events  - create a configuration file "blockchain.json". Includes factoryAddress for Ethereum Mainnet & Abi (json doc with array that describes functions of smart contract) 

**Thoughts**:


### Day 42: 2 August 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: To complete Stellar Side Quests I went back to NFT.Storage as per link in instructions and paid for storage but I think the link should have been directed to NFT.UP instead and I didn't need to pay. Error on NFT.UP when trying to add NFT image "Error: storing files: API Key is malformed or failed to parse."

Looking at help files on NFT.Storage it is unclear if I should be uploading tokens - so I will have to open a ticket. I don;t know if or when I will receive a response so I'll move on for now

**Thoughts**:


### Day 43: 8 August 2024  - day 

**Today's Progress**: Buy storage on NFTStorage to complete "Side Quest - Mint an NFT on Stellar - Publish an NFT on the Stellar blockchain "  ********** COMPLETE STELLAR PREQUESTS  - Will have to wait for next Stellar Smart Contract Challenge to start to take part when completed all SideQuests !!

**Thoughts**:


### Day 44: 16 August 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Minted NFT on Opensea and uploaded CID data from Pinata to NFT Storage for use in Stellar Challenge PreRequesites. 

**Thoughts**: unable to complete the stellar sidequest to mint nft on stellar - No video available so I will continue at later date



((started coursera M&A Specilaisation - will attempt to do that alongside the 100 days)) 



### Day 45: 30th August 2024  - Friday  

**Today's Progress**: Following Eat the Blocks tutorial to build decentralised prediction market on blockchain using ethereum, solidity and javascript

**Thoughts**: npx create-react-next-app . - Had to restart this not inc typescript



### Day 46: September1 12th 2024  - Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Attempting  Javascript desktop game. Preprquistits needed, Rust,  Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, WebView2, MSVC toolchain as default.

**Thoughts**: Had to restart to iron out original set up issues. 



### Day 47: September 13th 2024  - Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Back on track with desktop game after compiling to local host canvas. Next Step to import assets.  

**Thoughts**:
